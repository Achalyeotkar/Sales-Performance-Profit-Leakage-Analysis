# 📊 Sales Performance & Profit Leakage Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data for a retail company to understand why **profits are not increasing despite strong sales performance**.  
The goal is to identify **profit leakage caused by high discounts, low-margin products, inefficient regions, and operational factors**, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve overall profitability.

The analysis combines **data analytics, visualization, and machine learning** to support better business decision-making.

## 🏢 Business Problem
The company sells a large volume of products and generates high revenue, but overall profit growth is slow.  
Some products, regions, and customer segments are generating losses due to:
- Excessive discounts  
- Low-margin products  
- Inefficient regional performance  
- Operational factors such as shipping delays  

This project aims to identify **where and why profit leakage occurs** and how it can be reduced.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Increase overall profitability  
- Reduce unnecessary and excessive discounts  
- Identify loss-making products, categories, and regions  
- Improve pricing and sales strategy using data  
- Enable proactive decision-making using predictive analytics  

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions
- Which products are generating losses despite high sales?
- How do discounts impact profitability?
- Which regions have high sales but low profit efficiency?
- Which customer segments are most profitable?
- Which categories or sub-categories should be prioritized or avoided?
- Does shipping time affect profit margins?
